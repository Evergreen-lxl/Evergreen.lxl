# Evergreen
> ðŸŒ³ Treesitter support for Lite XL.

Evergreen adds Treesitter syntax highlighting support for Lite XL.
It is work in progress, but functions well.

> **Warning**
> Evergreen is only tested on Linux and will definitely not work on Windows.

# Requirements
- Lite XL 2.1+
- ltreesitter master via Luarocks (`luarocks install ltreesitter --local --dev`)

# Install
## Express Install
Evergreen can be easily installed with [Miq](https://github.com/TorchedSammy/Miq) by
adding this to your plugin declaration:
```lua
{'TorchedSammy/Evergreen.lxl', run = 'luarocks install ltreesitter --local --dev'},
```

## Manually
- Git clone Evergreen into Lite XL plugins directory
Or symlink:  
```
cd ~/Downloads
git clone https://github.com/TorchedSammy/Evergreen.lxl
ln -s ~/Downloads/Evergreen.lxl ~/.config/lite-xl/plugins/evergreen
```

# Usage
To use Evergreen, you have to install the parser for your language of choice.
This can be done with the `Evergreen: Install` command.  

The next thing to do is add style variables for the highlighting groups in
your config. This can be done like:
```lua
local style = require 'core.style'

style.syntax['<name>'] = '#ffffff'
```

There are a lot of highlight groups to have better control over what specific
parts to highlight. This may be overwhelming for some people though, so
some of these have aliases to the default Lite XL style variables,
and groups like `keyword.return` will default to the `keyword` group,
`conditional.ternary` will default to `conditional` if its set, etc.

Evergreen will warn in the log if there are any groups missing, you can
look at this to see what to set to highlight.

These are the available highlight groups:  
- `attribute`
- `boolean`: A group to highlight booleans specifically
- `character`
- `comment`
- `conditional`: Keywords relating to conditionals (`if`/`else`)
- `conditional.ternary`
- `constant`
- `constant.builtin`: Constants that are builtins to the language (Go's `iota`, `nil`)
- `define`
- `exception`: Keywords relating to exceptions (`try` and `catch`)
- `field`: Like a field in a Lua table
- `float`
- `function`: Function declaration
- `function.call`: Function call
- `function.macro`
- `include`: Keywords related to including modules/packages
- `keyword.function`: The function operator in a language (like `func` in Go)
- `keyword.operator`: Operators that are words (like `and`, `or` in Lua)
- `keyword.return`: The `return` operator
- `label`
- `method`
- `method.call`
- `namespace`
- `number`
- `operator`
- `parameter`: Parameters to a function (in declaration)
- `preproc`: Preprocessor directives (`#if` in C)
- `punctuation.delimiter`: Punctuation that delimits items (`,` and `:`)
- `punctuation.brackets`: Brackets of all kinds (`()` or `{}`, etc)
- `punctuation.special`: `#` in rust, treated as an operator by default
- `repeat`: Keywords relating to loops (`while`, `for`)
- `storageclass`: `static`, `const` in C
- `storageclass.lifetime`: Specifically for lifetimes in Rust currently
- `string`
- `text.diff.add`: Highlights additions in diffs
- `text.diff.delete`: Highlights deletions in diffs
- `type`
- `type.builtin`: Builtin types (`int`, `bool`)
- `type.definition`
- `type.qualifier`: Type qualifiers (`private`, `public`)
- `variable`
- `variable.builtin`: Builtin variables (`this`, `self`)
